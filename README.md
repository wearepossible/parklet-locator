# Parklet Plotter

The Parklet Plotter is a tool that allows the user to find a spot they think would be ideal for a new parklet. Weâ€™ve created it to help people learn more about the areas they live in - from which communities have the least access to green space to how different areas measure up against the multiple deprivation index. Where could parklets be installed to best help improve access to green space and give streets back to people and nature?

Buttons allow you to jump to specific cities, as well as switch between seeing public green space, access to public and private green space, deprivation levels, and car ownership per household. 

**Public Green Space** data comes from the [Ordnance Survey Open Green Space dataset](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-map-greenspace) (April 2021), with golf courses, allotments, and other semi-private green space removed.

**Access to Green Space** data comes from the [Office for National Statistics "Access to gardens and public green space" dataset](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/environmentalaccounts/datasets/accesstogardensandpublicgreenspaceingreatbritain) (April 2020).

**Index of Multiple Deprivation** data comes from the [Consumer Data Research Centre's IMD dataset](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/index-multiple-deprivation-imd) (2019), showing relative deprivation across the country in deciles.

**Cars Per Household** data comes from the [Department for Transport's VEH0104 dataset](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/open-map-greenspace) (Dec 2020), which consists of licensed vehicles by body type and region, including per head of population.
